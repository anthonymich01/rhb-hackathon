## P2P Supply Chain Financing for B2B 
**Scope to solve**: _(Shared responsibility on supply chain financing so Solves challenge 4)_
RHB don't need to provide a full loan. RHB still does the due diligence but we provide better UI/UX than now to onboard more retail users. RHB will disclose risks related to the financing too but in a simple manner. We need to figure out how to attract more investors as well. Maybe through higher rate of return 
Use blockchain to make sure data is stored properly. However, we should put more emphasis on buyer and seller KYC and verification because we want to make sure verifying the invoices that are valid and avoid bogus invoice that can lead buyers and sellers stealing bank’s money. We can improve existing processes through AI and ML as well as providing notification and checking credit score and historical data from the buyers and sellers. Design should be web first

## Digital Piggy Bank
**Scope to solve**: _Solves challenge 3 and 1_
Similar to EPF but for fresh grads and minors. Gamification is encouraged (notification and progress bar in each account). Kids can see their own money. Has to be under guardian. We can consider having a separate app with different UI for kids and the parents. Don't show the bank account in normal UI. Bank account for the piggy must be separated because we want to make sure that the piggy bank is a gamified store of money. The design must be mobile first.

**Few things in mind**:
- We will only go for 1st and 3rd idea since we voted.
- Don't work on the UI/UX too much for now since there might be changes in requirement and competition rules until the hackathon day. Work with low fidelity first
- BE can be decided later as long as it fits with our idea and preferably use AWS since it's their sponsor
- Don't create a bug free product since we are focusing on ideas. The grand finals will be more on enhancement.
- We can use the available UI library and free assets to demonstrate our idea. Focus on the flow chart first don’t create a fully functional until the hackathon day
